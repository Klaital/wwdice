# wwdice
Discord bot for rolling dice in the White Wolf style.

Syntax:

`<#of dice> <difficulty>[!]`

Use the difficulty to specify what the target number is, and add an exclamation point to cause 10's to explode.

Examples:

`3 6`: roll 3d10 against a difficulty of 6
`5 9!`: roll 5d10 against a difficulty of 9, allow 10's to explode.
